# Admission Test Documentation

This Admission Test was design to evaluate how well you know the technologies and concepts we use in our daily 
activities in DevSquad. You will be required to develop a **Task Board Management Application** following the 
instructions given in the following sections.

## Product Vision

The **Task Board Management Application** will allow users define their onw **Task Life Cycle** (adding or removing 
lanes to the Task Board) and use it to manage their tasks using Drag & Drop capabilities.

The application is a simplified version of tools like:  

 * [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/)
 * [Trello](https://trello.com/)

## Technology Stack

 * [Laravel 5.6](https://laravel.com/)
 * [Vue.js 2.x](https://vuejs.org/)
 * [Pusher](https://pusher.com/)

**Note 1**: 
````
Use the "Laravel Way" to implement the features of the application. Remember that we are interested in knowing how much 
you know about the framework and it's features.
